# 1) Customer Churn Prediction(Wtech_proje1)
In this part, you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bankâ€™s customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.

Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.
